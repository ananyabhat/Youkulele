# Description

Youkulele is an application to help users compose their own simple songs and then learn how to play them on the ukulele!

## Running the project

To run the project, run "compose.py" in your Python IDE.

## Dependencies

The dependencies needed to run this project are  PyAudio, Tkinter, Scipy, and Numpy.

## Key Bindings

Press "l" to go to the learning screen, "p" to go to the playing screen, and "m" to return to the composing page. In the learning screen, press "a" to animate the chord and "t" to learn the chord. When in the "teaching" mode, if you don't want to have to play the chord, press "s" to skip it (it will play through the animation, but won't require that you keep trying until you get the note right).
